# Research-Project
**This repository only contains some of the sampling outputs from the research project.**

## Project Abstract

  - The purpose of this research project is to develop an optimization algorithm that improves on compositionally-biased detection principle of the [SEG Algorithm](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ncbi-seg.1.html).
 
## Repository Content
  - Two circle packing plots showing the hierarchical classification analysis results. (**Scroll to see the entirety of the plots**)
    - The plots are modified to contains the following components:
      1. Neural Network lines to highlight the underlying relationships between nodes.
      2. Size of the clusters is dependent on the number of nodes assigned to them
      3. The positioning of the nodes is dependent on how well they match their assigned classification group. 
    - A corresponding csv file containing the classification assignment of each node. 
 
  - CSV files containing the optimized LCRs detection results.
  
  - A folder containing data visualization of each category amino acids components.
